# 研究方向

## Theoretical Foundation of Machine Learning
This research topic is to study the mathematical models for neural networks, and statistical convergence behavior of various machine learning algorithms.

## Parallel and Distributed Computational Algorithms
This research topic is concerned with system-aware auto-parallelization, efficient algorithms in synchronous and asynchronous manner, and scalable deep learning.

## Large-scale Applications
We are designing new statistically effective models, computationally efficient algorithms for large-scale applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and science. We are especially intrested in Generative AI and Large Language Models, such as prompt engineering, reasoning, and planning.
